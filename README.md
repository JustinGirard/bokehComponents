# bokehAnalytics
A platform used to rapidly develop bokeh interactive elements. Included are several illustrative examples

Bokeh is a very powerful rapid development library for python. Unfortunately, it is very code intensive, and unstructured. This means the only people that can leverage it understand how to wrap up complexity into abstracted modules. bokehAnalytics does exactly this; bokehAnalytics wraps up many common tasks within bokeh into standard components which play nice together. The goal is to provide both a high level interface for begineers, with many independent hooks and functionality for those that understand bokeh well.

bokehAnalytics is in active development, and is shared under the MIT license; you can create work with bokehAnalytics, and build it into a product if you like. You can not sell the code, or claim that the work is your own.
